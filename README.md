# The Open Project
Hello VGDC members!

To start contributing to the project, please join the Team page for this project at https://github.com/orgs/ubco-video-game-development-club/teams/open-project-2018.

## How to Contribute
This project allows everybody to contribute as little or as much as they want and still make a difference. It could be adding some voice lines, sound effects, a script, or sprites (images) - anything. This section goes through the steps of adding your creations to the project.

> Make sure you have joined the [Open Project 2018 Team page](https://github.com/orgs/ubco-video-game-development-club/teams/open-project-2018) and the [UBCO Video Game Development Club organization](https://github.com/orgs/ubco-video-game-development-club). You have to be added by an administrator, so either send Jaden Balogh a direct message through Discord, notify an admin in the Discord focused channel for the Open Project using @Admin, or send an email to ubcovgdc@gmail.com with your GitHub username.


Once you're setup, you can upload your files to the project. GitHub can be a bit hard to learn and understand, so we'll try to keep this process fairly straightforward:

1. Go to the [Code tab](https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club/open-project-2018) of the Open Project repository.
2. Click the button on the left-hand side that says "Branch: **master**" and type in a unique name that describes your changes (this can also just be your name) and press "Create branch: *name*". This creates a "branch" on which you can add changes without fear of messing up anything in the project.
